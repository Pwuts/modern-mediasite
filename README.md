## Make your Mediasite experience less ugly
Mediasite is ugly. I made this stylesheet to de-uglify it a bit.

With this stylesheet:

To use this stylesheet, get [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/blob/master/README.md#Releases), then click the button:

[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-116b59.svg?longCache=true&style=flat)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pwuts/modern-mediasite/master/Mediasite.user.css)

Currently, it works for the following Mediasites:
* TU Delft Collegerama
* Leiden University Weblectures

If this stylesheet works for your mediasite but it is not in the list, please open an issue or make a PR to fix it.

It should work if your mediasite looks something like this:
