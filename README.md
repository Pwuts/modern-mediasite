## Make your Mediasite experience less ugly
Mediasite is ugly. I made this stylesheet to make it a bit less ugly.

For now, it works for the following Mediasites:
* TU Delft Collegerama
* Leiden University Weblectures

If this stylesheet works for your mediasite but it is not in the list, please open an issue or make a PR to fix it.

It should work if your mediasite looks something like this:

With this stylesheet:
